Miga Light WordPress Theme
===

Hi. I'm a free WordPress Theme based on `underscores` and Bootstrap 4. Currently I am waiting for the approval on wordpress.org but you can already download me here and take me for a test drive. Don't forget to unzip the theme files and add the kirki package (https://github.com/aristath/kirki) to the 'inc' folder inside the Miga Light theme. 


Head over to http://webgeckos.com/miga-en to see more details about the theme. You can also check out the demos: http://webgeckos.com/miga-demo-1 and http://webgeckos.com/miga-demo-2.
